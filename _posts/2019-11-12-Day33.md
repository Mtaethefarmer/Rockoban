### **Summary**
*I started this task of by animating the crate first, seemed the easiest. After some research was conducted it may be better to not treat this as a normal animation but rather an tween from start to end position. The progress gif shows a sample of what I want to happen for each tile but in a random direction (up, down, left, right). Looks pretty good in my opinion just without the duplicate textures bug.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Todos**

* Log all Bugs as Issues with a Bug tag

* Log all Todos as Issues with a Feature request tag

* Spawn crates after a random amount of time

#### **Positive Notes**

* I am glad to be back working after taking such a long break.
