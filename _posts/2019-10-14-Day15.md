### **Summary**
*The game now starts from the Title screen but at the cost of some new bugs when loading in tiles from JSON. As the code base so does my fear of complex logic.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* There is a position offset that each tile needs have in order to be placed on the grid correctly. I thought of two ways to solve this but I cannot decided which one todo.
    * Option 1, would be to load the offset of each tile using the JSON. This would mean a lot of redundant data being used. The benefit is that I can use a single variable in the script to place the objects.
    * Option 2, would be to check the type of each tile before adding them to the grid to assign the right offset. This would have the opposite effect of Option 1. Less redundant data in the JSON but then my function would have to be expanded every time a new tile is added to the game. 

* I think I need to do a code review because while streaming I confused about my codebase and how the logic flows. It felt very uncomfortable knowing that my code was up to my own personal standards. I may use Friday as a day to refactor my stuff and write more debugging code.
    
#### **Positive Notes**

* After explaining my 'offset' dilemma to a colleague, Sam M., they suggested a possible solution. If I am checking that the JSON files have certain properties then I can check that there is an offset to use. Otherwise, I can use a default offset to place the tiles on the grid.
