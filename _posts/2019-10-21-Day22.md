### **Summary**
*Took longer than expected, but the first tile for the Pause Menu is in, still needs logic thou. Figured out how I wanted to handle the offset issue so there is not any unnecessary data, in the meantime.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should be looking at more cooperative puzzles to find out what works for my style of game. When I start designing new levels I want to have a fresh and plentiful outlook.

* I should show prototyping and implementing a level on stream, I feel very  close to being able to do just that and produce up to 2 levels at a time.

* I am unsure if I should aim to be a twitch affiliate as apart of my game  development process. It does feel a bit extra but also a missed opportunity.
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* I feel happy about being so close to rapid prototyping status. Looking back it does feel like it was a road to get here, but now that I can. I feel more focused on designing new levels.
