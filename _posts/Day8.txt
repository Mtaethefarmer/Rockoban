**Day 008[Great]**

**Goal: Push the Crates into the Hole [Incomplete]**

Both players can push crates independently. Right now they just snap into place
but later I will add some smooth transitions for them. Almost lost faith in the
sudo-code that I wrote but it still worked as planned. ...Or as well as game 
development plans go. 

**[Improvements]**
- Do not overuse global events when, local one can work just fine. I tried
    solving a problem using Global Events and that caused each instanced crate
    to move when 1 signal was emitted.

- To reiterate the importance of not over-using Global Events, it also caused
    a recursion bug which could have locked up my computer. Instead, it 
    overloaded the print stream/debugger, so I know I got lucky.

- There was a lot of noise when I first started streaming, maybe I should ask 
    the people around to lower their voices, so that I can also.

- I should investigate why OBS is taking my mouse input the wrong way. It is 
    causing my mouse to snap to panel/window why OBS is on screen. This did
    cost me some time when I was initially ready to stream.
    

**[Positive Note]**
- Showed off the 7 Day Badge! 

- I am getting better about responding to messages on ReStream, I think that
    was because I had more people and my parents watching me stream. Happy to 
    have the support from so many people, thou.
