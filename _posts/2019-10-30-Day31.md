### **Summary**
*With all of the levels now implemented in-game I was able to focus on fixing the win condition. Simple enough, all it took was a switch from using less than to greater when comparing which levels were valid levels. With the remaining time I had left it was time to add another animation to the player for more feedback when I player selected one of those GUI buttons.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* Players can still go to the next level in the pause menu if they touch each other.

#### **Todos**

* Re-add the black background when moving the Main Menu.

* *Same as Day 30*
    * Fix the size of the level select buttons

* Create a banner using the bagdes recieved from the challenge and use on website.

* Put 30 day badge on stream. 

#### **Positive Notes**

* Good job today with the way today's goals were scoped. I was able to accomplish a good handful of them within the stream. I want to keep this up for the rest of the stream because it feels good to complete multiple tasks in an hour. Instead of using the whole time to implement a complex feature.
