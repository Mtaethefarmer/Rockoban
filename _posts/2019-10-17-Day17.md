### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* Crates can push each other. I should be checking which pawn wants to move the crate to fix that.

#### **Todos**

* It was suggested that I allow voice chat since I do not have many views at the moment. I would not be bothersome and it would allow me to have more fluid conversations while streaming. 

* Now that there is a level to play in I notice that there is a lack of sounds going on in the game. The world sounds very empty, cold with fluorescent lights.

* I should find a better way to inform myself that I could not get a pawn from a certain grid position. Right now it will spam the debug console which will make me lose other important messages if they come up.
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* I was done designing the level quite early and it gave me time to playtest it to find any special cases like the bug mentioned above. Glad I found it before someone else did. 

* My friends are involved in the stream. Louis came by and played his guitar on-stream and Abi joined in the chat
