DAY 4[Bad]

Goal: Grid-based movement [Incomplete]

I struggled to get started with Grid-based movement. I think it was due to my
 lack of preparation and overall knowledge of how I wanted to implement it.

[Improvements]
- If I setup my streaming/social media networks the day prior I can cut down on
    my setup time.
- I did watch a video on Grid-based movement 45 minutes prior to streaming but
    I had no notes or psuedo-code to reference while developing which made me 
    feel lost in what to do next.
- I should treat the 1-hour time limit with more respect. One of my teammates 
    distracted me for a few minutes with our school project. I will let them 
    know later that I am unavaible during that time. Still love all the hard
    work they do.

[Positive Note]
- Made a new friend on Twitch, Wraithan,while streaming. YAY!
