### **Summary**
*Fixed many of the bugs that came with getting the players to Level One cleanly. And I know I keep saying it but, this time I swear, I can start making levels.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* When the game starts I am not able to determine which character I am playing. I should add more feedback to each controller/player when they start the game.

* I should focus on making a good game rather than being an entertaining streamer. Some advice from Louis, a colleague of mine, was to make sure that my goals are clear when streaming to the viewers. Game development means doing the research and fixing bugs. This opposes having an entertaining stream. We also talked about time management and if I wanted to be more entertaining I need to devote more time to knowing what features I am making prior to streaming which is not possible for me.
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* My entire codebase is documented! Now I can build off of that when adding new features.

* I spent a few minutes after the stream fixing a bug that caused multiple players to be on the grid at the same time.
