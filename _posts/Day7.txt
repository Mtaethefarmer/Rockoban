**Day 007[Good]**

**Goal: Animate the Player(s) [Complete]**

Both players have a walk animation when moing around the world. I enjoy that 
there is a walk sound effect that each of them make when moving around the 
board also. 

**[Improvements]**
- AudioStreamPlayers changed since the last time I used one. I thought it would
    work similar to the AnimationPlayer and let me load multiple sounds but not
    the case. 

- Celebrations are good but I still got to focus to making a game. This sprint 
    felt like a way to celebrate Day 7 but I felt like I could have used my
    time more wisely to get the next main mechanic in the game.

- I should showcase the each of the badges on my stream when I get it, cuz
    I'm proud of them.

- I want to make my stream more interesting for others to watch. Maybe I'll add
    some smooth music in the background. or Rewatch one of my streams to do more
    self critquing. 
    

**[Positive Note]**
- *Same from Day 6*
    Breaking down the tasks into smaller bits really helps me stay focused on one
    thing at a time. This time I wrote down some solutions for how to animate the 
    players and decided while streaming which one I wanted to implement.

- So far a different person everyday has come by to say hi. This time I was able to
    respond to the message within a few minutes. I wonder if restream plays a sound
    to notify streamers of the chat.
