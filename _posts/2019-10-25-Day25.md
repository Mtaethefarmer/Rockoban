---
### **Mood:     [Great]**

---
### **Summary**
*Seamless level transitions! With the added affect of base levels that I can use to create many other variant levels.*

---
### **Next Goal**
*Implement a Level Select Menu...*

---
### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should improve the JSON Parser to read multiple JSON files instead of only one level deep. I could use that feature to combine many sub-levels into one. There is a function that will assist this process on the Godot forums:
    * https://godotengine.org/qa/8024/update-dictionary-method
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* I feel great about getting 12 prototypes designed. It feels like a lot of progress was made for an hour and I am going to have fun playing those levels in game.
