**Day 014[MEH]**

**Goal: Load Level One[Incomplete]**

Levels are being read in from JSON files. After stepping on the StartTile the
    game will load Level One. Now all that is left is to create an actual
    puzzle for the players to solve.

**[Improvements]**
- I should do some bounds checking on placing tiles in the grid. Today, I had
    an error with placing tiles. When I specified the position of the tile it 
    would not appear on screen. It was due to me placing it outside of 
    the grid space I was using 13 by 8. With bounds checking I will at least 
    display a message letting me know when I do that in the future.

- *Same as Day 4.*
    I should treat the 1-hour time limit with more respect. I decided to go
    over the specified time limit because I spent the first 30 minutes doing
    research on how to read JSON files with Godot. 
    
**[Positive Note]**
- My presence for this challenge is getting more attention. More and more 
    people from my school recognize that I am streaming game development
    as they pass by. 

- I tuned into Pigdev's stream this morning and was delighted to see other 
    users of Godot having conversations about signals and event management.
