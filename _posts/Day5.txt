Day 005[Good]

Goal: Grid-based movement [Incomplete]

I was able to get the player to request to move from the Grid. This method
centralizes where I resolve movement for every object on the board decreasing
places I have to search for logic. 

[Improvements]
- Getting working code is good but I am left at the end to comment my code. 
    Commenting my thoughts and copying from the Stub file I made should be
    doable. 

[Positive Note]
- Taking the time to write down psuedo-code for the Grid made me feel much
    more comfortable coding and streaming at the same time. I could refer 
    to the psuedo-code when I got lost or sidetracked.
- Some of my friends and family came by to say hi, made me feel supported
    and not alone. Thanks, fam!
- I felt good to be ready and streaming 5 minutes prior to my initial 
    start-time, I even had a second controller ready.
