### **Summary**
*Changed the design of the Level select menu to get past a bug. It will haunt me for the lifetime of my game until I fix it or come up with a better design which makes the feature dumb to have.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* When attempting to go to another level, if the button is 1 by 2, [ | ] then the left side does not get a node to reference the level with, so the Grid cannot get a tile thier because technically the node only exsist on the right side.

* When levels have different font sizes they inhiert the last one used.

* Cannot access variables on tiles that have grown, because the node only exsists in one location and GrowTile() only modifies the grid.

#### **Todos**

* I should make sure to save all properties of the Pawns when saving the level. i.e any pawn that should have a specific color. Otherwise they will go back to the default.

* I should start logging the bugs I notice with github's issue tracker.

* Delete intermitten save data as game is being closed.

* I should modifiy GrowPawn to put a Pawn in the spot where Pawns grow. Since technically all pawns are 1 by 1, [ ], tiles.

* I should add a way to convert from Color to ColorN. Possibly by searching for the nearest color value.

#### **Positive Notes**

* Tracking alot of bugs today. I glad for the awareness. 

* Met @croak, one of the other challengers of the 100 Days of Game Dev Challenge. I was exciting to recieve advice from him and get words of encouragement. We bonded over the similarities that our games have and I look fowarded to seeing his posts everyday.
