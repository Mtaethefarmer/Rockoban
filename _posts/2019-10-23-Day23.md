### **Summary**
*Pause screen is looking great, with half the buttons fully implemented. This makes the game quite close to having a coherent game loop.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should make a default button to speed up the UI implementation process. That way I have more time to play with the color scheme or color of each button from JSON, cause I had fun doing that with my box o' crayons.

- I should add more logic to the winning state. Right now the player can win at any time during the game that includes in the Main Menu and on the Pause screen. I would accidentally "Win" causing a deadlock in the game which I would have to restart the game to stop.
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* I feel happy about being so close to rapid prototyping status. Looking back it does feel like it was a road to get here, but now that I can. I feel more focused on designing new levels.
