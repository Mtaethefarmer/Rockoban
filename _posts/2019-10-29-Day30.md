### **Summary**
*Most of the levels were put into the game today. Still, have 2 left... Production of new levels does not take very long, I would confidently say I could prototype 2~3 levels and have them in-game within an hour.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* Players can no longer progress through the levels by touching the other player. Which means winning the game is impossible.

#### **Todos**

* Fix the size of the level buttons by:
    - Checking to the left of the grid position for a level tile.
    - Using collision on the player and button to emit a signal

* Implement the last 2 levels

* Give the player an animation when selecting a button tile to signify a selection. Right now it is way to quick and transitions instantly.



#### **Positive Notes**

* Today's stream was good because of how quickly I got those levels into the game. That makes me feel confident going forward about adding new levels to the game.
