### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should not rush the setup of my stream. I forgot to change the title listed on the streaming website because it was not apart of my checklist. I also forgot to change which mic I was using. 
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* A new random stranger appeared at high noon(close to when the stream was  ending). I wish I had a chance to say hi but I think they heard me say how much I appreciate them showing up.
