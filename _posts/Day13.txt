**Day 013[GOOD]**

**Goal: Have Players go to the Main Menu[Complete]**

Anytime the player wants to go back to the main menu they can step on the 
Main Menu Tiles, to send them back. Also, the types of tiles have been 
upgraded to global types.

**[Improvements]**
- I should figure out why Godot is hanging until I open the terminal window.
    It continues to take up a few minutes at a time and interrupts my thought
    process. Grrr... so frustrating!

- If I am going to stream in the new location I need to find a way to have the
    chat screen somewhere I can see it update somewhere I can see it. This time
    I had to constantly turn my phone on and unlock it to see what was going 
    on.

- I want to make sure the terminology that I use for the comments in the game 
    stay consistent so I will log some of them here for future reference:
    ~ Grid Position = location in grid coordinates 
    ~ Tile          = any object that can be placed on the grid
    
**[Positive Note]**
- My brother came to say hi on stream and watched until I was done. This is a 
    victory for me because we have not spoken for some time.

- The new location has really good lighting and I plan to stream from there for
    now on. I really liked how clear I could see myself while streaming.
