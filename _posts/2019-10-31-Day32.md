### **Summary**
*The players now will shoot up into space when selecting the resume game or restart tile. It was abit frustruating to get working because I was unfamiliar with yield function but looks great now that it is in.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* Animation for players selecting buttons does not always work.

#### **Todos**

* Have the rest of buttons wait for the player to finish with animation

* Find a way to guarentee the animation will play before clearing grid

#### **Positive Notes**

* I feel like the game is coming alive with the more animations I add to the world.
