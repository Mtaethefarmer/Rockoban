### **Summary**
*As long as Nodes implement the Save() it can be written to a JSON file called "SaveData.json". Unfortunately, loading it back into the level after players want to resume playing breaks the game.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should write more comments for the Grid script as I forgot some stuff. This will be extended to other scripts also as I do reviews of them. All scripts should have:   
    * File header
        * File name
        * Author
        * Brief description
        * Discussions
    * Class description
    * Function header
        * Description
        * Parameters used (if needed)
        * Return value (if needed)

* I should optimize the way I save data. Right now I am iterating through the grid twice to find the position. This could be done once to capture the value. I could also have the children store their grid position because it is constant time as far I know.    

#### **Positive Notes**

* Getting the game to save, was not as hard as getting the game to load. It took me less time to do research and get working, which felt nice.
