### **Summary**
*Created 12 prototypes to be added to the game. They all had a similar setup but a different crate placement which produced some interesting solutions.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* If I am going to have the buttons inherit from the default button I should add the default button properties to JSON file and the JSON Parser. Being generic about these objects and possibly other objects will speed up development time and allow me more time to prototype and playtest, YAAASSS!!

* I should make the JSON Parser recursive so that I can have less redundant data.
    * Base levels share a group of tiles 
    * Child levels have the important tiles that vary per level
    * Will concatenate two Dictionaries together 
    

#### **Positive Notes**

* I feel great about getting 12 prototypes designed. It feels like a lot of progress was made for an hour and I am going to have fun playing those levels in game.
