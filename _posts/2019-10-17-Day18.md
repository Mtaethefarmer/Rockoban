### **Summary**
*Using both the R2 and Start Menu buttons players can pause the game. Loads of bugs were found this way, I'll be excited to see them go.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* The R2 button can pause the game also because one of the controllers I use maps its Start Button to the same button R2 is for. 

* The player fall in the parallel processing pitfall. Since both players  share the same script input becomes doubled by default. Finding a way for them to have the same codebase without duplicating code is my goal.

* Crates can push the last one in at end of a line of crates. It makes it seem that force from the player into the crates transfers to the last one.

#### **Todos**

* I should select all devices on the Input Map instead of individual devices. This would be to future proof if I decide to add more than two players to the game.

#### **Positive Notes**

* I found a better way to guarantee that Input handling is only happening once. https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24944

* Even with midterms happening, I still find time to stream.
