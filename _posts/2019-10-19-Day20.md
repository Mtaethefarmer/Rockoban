### **Summary**
*Both players have their data being saved and loaded while pausing. While doing this I realized some of the issues I have with having the logic for both players in the same script.*

### **TLDR**

#### **Bugs**

* *None found this day*

#### **Todos**

* I should separate both player's logic so that I will not have more bugs show up as I added more features to the players. Thinking about it now I could assign the Player Id as controllers are detected by the game and use thatm to consolidate the code. Hrmm...
    

#### **Positive Notes**
