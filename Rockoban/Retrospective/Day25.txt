**Day 025[GREAT]**

**Goal: Add a new level to the game[Complete]**

Seamless level transitions! With the added affect of base levels that I can
use to create many other variant levels. 

**[Improvements]**
- I should improve the JSON Parser to read multiple JSON files instead of only
    one level deep. I could use that feature to combine many sub-levels into
    one. There is a function that will assist this process on the Godot forums:

**[Positive Note]**
- I feel great about getting 12 prototypes designed. It feels like a lot of 
    progress for an hour and I am going to have fun playing them in the game.
