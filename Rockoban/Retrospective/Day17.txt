**Day 017[GREAT]**

**Goal: Prototype a level [Complete]**
Prototyped and created Level 1 which has both players move crates to reach each
other.

**[Improvements]**
- I should find a better way to inform myself that I could not get a pawn from
    a certain grid position. Right now it will spam the debug console which
    will make me lose other important messages if they come up.

- Now that there is a level to play in I notice that there is a lack of sounds
    going on in the game. The world sounds very empty, cold with fluorescent 
    lights.

- It was suggested that I allow voice chat since I do not have many views at
    the moment. I would not be bothersome and it would allow me to have more 
    fluid conversations while streaming. 

- *Bug*
    Crates can push each other. I should be checking which pawn wants to move
    the crate to fix that. 

**[Positive Note]**
- I was done designing the level quite early and it gave me time to playtest it
    to find any special cases like the bug mentioned above. Glad I found it
    before someone else did. 

- My friends are involved in the stream. Louis came by and played his guitar 
    on-stream and Abi joined in the chat
