**Day 012[GOOD]**

**Goal: Have Players go to the Main Menu[Incomplete]**

To get started on getting the Players to the Main Menu, I had to instance the players and Menu buttons using code. This will allow me to load them back in
the game when at the Main Menu. The same technique will be used to load the buttons for the Main Menu and every other level need in the game.

**[Improvements]**
- I should move the TileType Enum to the globals script. Right now I have 3 
    sets of code that need to have the same enum types which (I can see now
    looking into the future) I will forget to update all of them when I add 
    a new type of tile.

- After writing the AddPawn() for Grid, a bug appeared where new objects cannot     be placed on top of each other. Instead, they are not placed and it leaves      an open tile where it would go. I should clear the board before trying to       set down new menu tiles to avert this bug.

- *Same as Day 11*
    Since I did not stream over the weekend I did not take the time to complete
    marketing/social tasks that I think would aid the streaming experience for 
    others who watch.
    Other ones to add:
    ~ Playing some music in the background to help drown out the ambient noise
        that come from the other students around getting work done.
    ~ Asking the people who do tune in what would make them stay longer and         watch to get ideas of what I should be doing.
    
**[Positive Note]**
- After that streaming session, 10+ new people were logged as visiting my            Facebook page that I set up for the stream.
