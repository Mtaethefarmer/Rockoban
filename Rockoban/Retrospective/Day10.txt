**Day 010[Good]**

**Goal: Have Players Win the Game[Incomplete]**

When the players touch each other, they cause the 'You Win' screen to appear.
Going forward when this happens 3 seperate tiles will allow the players to 
continue to the next level, restart the level or quit. 

**[Improvements]**
- I couldn't help myself going over the time limit. I was excited to implement
    the 'You Win' menu as part of the game mechanics. Similar to fighting games
    players will get to vote on which option they would like to choose by
    walking over the tiles.

- *Same as Day 9*
    I was not prepared to implement the 'You Win' screen at the beginning of 
    the streaming session. Clearly, I should be spending more time on the 
    design as development continues. So that I have a stronger idea of what I
    should be working on.

- I should reflect on the whole week during the weekend, so that I can address
    some of the other Improvements that I miss during the week.
    
**[Positive Note]**
- Today would have been a Great Day if I was able to keep to the time limit.
    Alas, I was still excited to come up with a creative idea.

- Now I have a checklist of the routine used while taking on this challenge.
    This will keep me more organized for the long run when things get busy
    at school.
