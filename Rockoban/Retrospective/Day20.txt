**Day 020[MEH]**

**Goal: Save a level before pausing [Incomplete]**

Both players have their data being saved and loaded while pausing. While doing
this I realized some of the issues I have with having the logic for both 
players in the same script.

**[Improvements]**
- I should separate both player's logic so that I will not have more bugs show
    up as I added more features to the players. Thinking about it now I could 
    assign the Player Id as controllers are detected by the game and use that
    to consolidate the code. Hrmm...

**[Positive Note]**
