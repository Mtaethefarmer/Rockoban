**Day 010[MEH]**

**Goal: Have Players Win the Game[Complete]**

The User Interface is now integrated into the game as a mechanic. Menu options
will show up as tiles that each player can walk on to confirm selections. At first, I wanted different levels of confirmation for each one but that turned out to be too complicated.

**[Improvements]**
- I want to recognize faster when I am trying to do something more complex than 
    it needs to be. I spend 30 or so minutes trying to get different levels of 
    confirmation for each menu option instead of implementing the easier 
    option. The trouble I have is wanting a system that is less
    prone to errors in the future and having something to show at the end of
    the session.

- As I set up for the session, I ponder what can be done to let others know 
    about the 100 Days of Game Dev Challenge and what I am doing for it. 
    Just as a note for myself here are some of those things:
        ~ Updating the page for each streaming platform to look more
            professional
        ~ Intro/Outro Sequence
        ~ Asking my friends in person, if they would subscribe/follow my
            streams, twitter or other social media platforms
        ~ Adding a timer on the stream to let people who tune in early when
            the stream is starting
        ~ Do a recap video of some of the interesting parts from the last few 
            days, this is a devlog I believe
    
**[Positive Note]**
- I may have found a new spot to stream, which is quieter and has walls to help     me concentrate without the background noise.

- I drew some designs for the User Interface in my notes journal. The more          design wrote I do the better I feel about the direction I am going with the     game.
