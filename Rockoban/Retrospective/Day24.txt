**Day 024[GREAT]**

**Goal: Add a new level to the game[Incomplete]**

Created 12 prototypes to be added to the game. They all had a similar setup
but a different crate placement which produced some interesting solutions.

**[Improvements]**
- If I am going to have the buttons inherit from the default button I should
    add the default button properties to JSON file and the JSON Parser. Being
    generic about these objects and possibly other objects will speed up
    development time and allow me more time to prototype and playtest, YAAASSS!!

- I should make the JSON Parser recursive so that I can have less redundant data.
    ~ Base levels share a group of tiles 
    ~ Child levels have the important tiles that vary per level
    ~ Will concatenate two Dictionaries together 

**[Positive Note]**
- I feel great about getting 12 prototypes designed. It feels like alot of 
    progress for an hour and I am going to have fun playing them in the game.
