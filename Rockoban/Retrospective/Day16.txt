**Day 016[MEH]**

**Goal: Transition from Main Menu to Level One[Complete]**
Fixed many of the bugs that came with getting the players to Level One cleanly.
And I know I keep saying it but, this time I swear, I can start making levels.

**[Improvements]**
- When the game starts I am not able to determine which character I am playing.
    I should add more feedback to each controller/player when they start the 
    game. 

- I should focus on making a good game rather than being an
    entertaining streamer. Some advice from Louis, a colleague of mine, was to 
    make sure that my goals are clear when streaming to the viewers. Game development means doing the research and fixing bugs. This opposes having
    an entertaining stream. We also talked about time management and if I wanted
    to be more entertaining I need to devote more time to knowing what features
    I am making prior to streaming which is not possible for me.

**[Positive Note]**
- My entire codebase is documented! Now I can build off of that when adding new
    features.

- I spent a few minutes after the stream fixing a bug that caused multiple
    players to be on the grid at the same time.
