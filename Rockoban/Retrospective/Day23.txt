**Day 023[GREAT]**

**Goal: Implement newly designed Pause Screen[Complete]**

Pause screen is looking great, with half the buttons fully implemented. This
makes the game quite close to having a coherent game loop. 

**[Improvements]**
- I should make a default button to speed up the UI implementation process.
    That way I have more time to play with the color scheme or color of each
    button from JSON, cause I had fun doing that with my box o' crayons.

- I should add more logic to the winning state. Right now the player can 
    win at any time during the game that includes in the Main Menu and on the
    Pause screen. I would accidentally "Win" causing a deadlock in the game
    which I would have to restart the game to stop.

**[Positive Note]**
- I feel happy about being so close to rapid prototyping status. Looking back
    it does feel like it was a road to get here, but now that I can. I feel 
    more focused on designing new levels.
    
**[Next Goal]Add a new level to the game...**
