**Day 019[GOOD]**

**Goal: Save a level before pausing [Incomplete]**

As long as Nodes implement the Save() it can be written to a JSON file called
"SaveData.json". Unfortunately, loading it back into the level after
players want to resume playing breaks the game.

**[Improvements]**
- I should write more comments for the Grid script as I forgot some stuff. This
    will be extended to other scripts also as I do reviews of them. All scripts
    should have:
        ~ File header
            - File name
            - Author
            - Brief description
            - Discussions
        ~ Class description
        ~ Function header
            - Description
            - Parameters used (if needed)
            - Return value (if needed)

- I should optimize the way I save data. Right now I am iterating through the 
    grid twice to find the position. This could be done once to capture the 
    value. I could also have the children store their grid position because 
    it is constant time as far I know.

**[Positive Note]**
- Getting the game to save, was not as hard as getting the game to load. It 
    took me less time to do research and get working, which felt nice.
