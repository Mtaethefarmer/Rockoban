**Day 009[Good]**

**Goal: Push the Crates into the Hole [Complete]**

Crates will fall into holes, opening up path new pathways for both players. 

**[Improvements]**
- I should investigate a bug where signals for crates moving are being fired 
    off six times or more everytime the player pushes the crate.

- I should spend more time describing the design of the game. I am starting to
    have more ideas about how people will play this game, writing down those 
    ideas and pitching them to others should make my gameplay stronger.

- Having an intro and outro would be a nice way to let people know what my 
    entire plan for this challenge is.
    

**[Positive Note]**
- I had a few minutes after I accomplished my goal and I used it to comment
    the Crate script. More documentation equals and easier time navigating the
    logic.

- Wraithan assisted me this stream as a rubber ducky and pro bug solver. It was
    nice to know someone had my back. I am going to pay attention to his stream
    becauase he seems very knowlegdable, I could learn a thing or two.
