**Day 021[GOOD]**

**Goal: Save a level before pausing [Complete]**

Every pawn is now being saved and loaded upon pausing the game! I also had
a chance to fix some other minor bugs and do some more code reviews.

**[Improvements]**
- I should not rush the setup of my stream. I forgot to change the title listed
    on the streaming website because it was not apart of my checklist. I also
    forgot to change which mic I was using. 

**[Positive Note]**
- A new random stranger appeared at high noon(close to when the stream was 
    ending). I wish I had a chance to say hi but I think they heard me say
    how much I appreciate them showing up.
