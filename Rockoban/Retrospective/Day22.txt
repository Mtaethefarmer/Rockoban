**Day 022[MEH]**

**Goal: Implement newly designed Pause Screen[Incomplete]**

Took longer than expected, but the first tile for the Pause Menu is in,
still needs logic thou. Figured out how I wanted to handle the offset issue
so there is not any unnecessary data, in the meantime.

**[Improvements]**
- I should be looking at more cooperative puzzles to find out what works
    for my style of game. When I start designing new levels I want to have a 
    fresh and plentiful outlook.

- I should show prototyping and implementing a level on stream, I feel very 
    close to being able to do just that and produce up to 2 levels at a time.

- I am unsure if I should aim to be a twitch affiliate as apart of my game 
    development process. It does feel a bit extra but also a missed 
    opportunity.

**[Positive Note]**
- I feel happy about being so close to rapid prototyping status. Looking back
    it does feel like it was a road to get here, but now that I can. I feel 
    more focused on designing new levels.
