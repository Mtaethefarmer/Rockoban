Day 006[Great]

Goal: Grid-based movement [Complete]

Both players now move independantly of each other, even thou I couldn't
showcase it. Started animating the players movement and bumping into 
stuff also. Went into 15 minute overtime to solve my bug, unforunately.

[Improvements]
- Gotta be careful about the nodes I am editing, I caused my to think there
    was a bug in my code. I animated the Node2D position instead of the 
    Sprite.
- Same from Day 3
    Another day working only with one controller. I was too late to check one
     out from the library, but I should just bring one from home and leave it
     with my other one.

- Same from Day 5.
    Getting working code is good but I am left at the end to comment my code. 

- I should ask my friends who watch me, for more advice or include them in
    project somehow. I did not notice that one of them had joined so I never
    took the time to say hi. D:


[Positive Note]
- Breaking down the tasks into smaller bits really helps me stay focused on one
    thing at a time. Before the stream I wrote down 5 things that I wanted to 
    get done for this stream and was only able to complete the first 3 tasks.

- Same from Day 5.
    One of my friends and family came by to say hi, made me feel supported
    and not alone. Thanks, fam!

- I felt good to be ready and streaming 5 minutes prior to my initial 
    start-time, I even had a second controller ready.
