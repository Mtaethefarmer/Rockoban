**Day 018[GOOD]**

**Goal: Implement a way for the players to Pause the game[Complete]**

Using both the R2 and Start Menu buttons players can pause the game. Loads
of bugs were found this way, I'll be excited to see them go.

**[Improvements]**
- I should select all devices on the Input Map instead of individual devices.
    This would be to future proof if I decide to add more than two players
    to the game.

- *Bug*
    The R2 button can pause the game also because one of the controllers I use
    maps its Start Button to the same button R2 is for. 

- *Bug*
    The player fall in the parallel processing pitfall. Since both players 
    share the same script input becomes doubled by default. Finding a way for
    them to have the same codebase without duplicating code is my goal.

- *Bug*
    Crates can push the last one in at end of a line of crates. It makes it
    seem that force from the player into the crates transfers to the last one.

**[Positive Note]**
- I found a better way to guarantee that Input handling is only happening once.

- Even with midterms happening, I still find time to stream. 
    
**[Next Goal]Save a level before pausing...**
